# Research: README for Build and Deployment

## Decision: Use Markdown for the README file

**Rationale**: Markdown is the standard format for README files on GitHub and is widely understood by developers. It allows for clear formatting and is easy to edit.

**Alternatives considered**:
*   **HTML**: More complex to write and maintain.
*   **Plain Text**: Lacks the formatting capabilities needed for a clear and readable document.
